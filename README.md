# Machine Learning Assignments - Fall 2024

## Overview
This repository serves as an archive of assignments completed for the Machine Learning course at the University of Kerman during Fall 2024. Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment, including both practical implementations and theoretical assignemnt solutions.

## Usage
The repository is organized to provide easy access to individual assignments, each contained within its own folder. **Each folder includes a dedicated README file** detailing the specific objectives, methods, and outcomes of the assignment. The code and reports are intended for educational purposes.

## Directory Structure
- **Analyzing Titanic Survival Rates - Practical**: Exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.
- **Decision Tree - ID3 - Practical**: Implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm.
- **Linear Regression - Practical**: Practical application of linear regression with dataset analysis.
- **Noise Reduction with PCA and Autoencoders**: Noise reduction using PCA and Autoencoders on Fashion MNIST.

## Libraries Used
The assignments were implemented in Python, utilizing the following libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and dataset handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms (e.g., PCA, linear regression) and preprocessing.
- **PyTorch**: For neural network implementation (e.g., Autoencoders).
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
